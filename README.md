# Saltire
## Overview
Saltire is an esoteric programming language based off of holographic reduced representation. Its main and conscious inspirations are Hollang and Nock ('conscious', because it may have been possible that Saltire was inspired by other programming languages without thinking of it). The language was created on the 24th of May, 2020. It is minimalistic, using only 5 instruction characters to manipulate bit vectors as a form of computation.
